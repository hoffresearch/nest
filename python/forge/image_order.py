"""Greedy nearest-neighbour ordering of frames before the encode.

Measured in fase 0: ordering a corpus by visual similarity buys about +6.6
percent compression on unrelated images, because ordering cannot invent
redundancy that is not there. So it is a flag, never the default. Where it
can matter is scan-ordered material (wsi tiles), and that is where fase 6
measures it.

The permutation contract: `order[k]` is the original index of the k-th
frame in the encoded stream. The builder encodes in stream order and then
maps vectors, hashes, and uris back to item order, so a chunk always names
its own image no matter where the stream carried it.
