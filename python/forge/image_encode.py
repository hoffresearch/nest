"""Encode side of image corpus media: the av1 stream encoder.

Backend selection and the control corpus live in `forge/image_backends.py`;
the per-image encoders (avif, jxl) in `forge/image_encode_still.py`; the
gop probe in `forge/image_gop_probe.py`. This module keeps the stream
encoder and the shared provenance record.

Provenance is recorded on every encode: the decoded pixels depend on the
exact toolchain (ffmpeg version, encoder, parameters), and another version
produces other pixels, other embeddings, and an index that silently stops
matching the media. `provenance_sha256` fingerprints that toolchain.

Every encode probes what was actually written (frame count, pix_fmt):
an encoder that falls back silently turns a flag into a lie.
