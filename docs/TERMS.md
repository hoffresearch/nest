# Terms

The abbreviations used in the repository's names, one meaning each. Names follow the equal-length rule of [ADR-0003](adr/structure/0003-equal-length-siblings-and-a-shared-lexicon.md): siblings of the same kind have the same length, and the length table there says which length each folder's children take.

Three rules keep the lexicon useful:

1. One abbreviation, one meaning. `cmp` never means compile in one place and compare in another.
2. No synonym invented to fill characters. Reuse the project's vocabulary first: a word already in a name, or an abbreviation already listed here.
3. A new abbreviation enters this file in the same pull request that creates the name.

`tool/tasks/namecheck.py` reads the table below in CI: an abbreviation listed twice fails, and so does an entry that cites a name the tree does not have or that does not contain the abbreviation. Whole words (`bridge`, `engine`, `orchestra`) and the names of tools and products (`pypi`, `conda`, `nixos`, `av1`, `clip`) are not abbreviations and are not listed.
